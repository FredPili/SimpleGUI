GUI that displays a 2D sinwave, possiblity to choose : DONE
    the angle, 
    the frequency, 
    the number of sample points (image resolution),
    The colormap

The image must stay the same size in the GUI no matter the number of sample points


Future ideas : 
    - Add the possiblity to display 1D sinwaves 
    - Add a fourier transform visualization DONE
    - Possibility to add mutliple frequencies DONE
    - Seperate logic from UI
    - Implement an evet bus to avoid having to recompute the 
    image for each callacks if not needed.
