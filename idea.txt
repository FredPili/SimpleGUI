GUI that displays a 2D sinwave, possiblity to choose : DONE
    the angle, 
    the frequency, 
    the number of sample points (image resolution),
    The colormap

The image must stay the same size in the GUI no matter the number of sample points


Future ideas : 
    - Add the possiblity to display 1D sinwaves 
    - Add a fourier transform visualization            DONE
    - Possibility to add mutliple frequencies          DONE
    - Seperate logic from UI                           DONE
    - Implement an evet bus to avoid having to recompute the 
    image for each callacks if not needed.             DONE
    - Implement frequency deletion                     DONE
    - Implement scrollbar                              DONE
    - Implement a load/save function to load
    or save a set of frequencies                       DONE
    - Implement a player that plays a scripted sequnce
    of paramter change. e.g. changing phase and frquency over time.   DONE
    - Add package support for the EventBus
    - Make sequences for different frequencies         DONE
    - Implement dataclasses for waves and sequences
