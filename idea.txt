GUI that displays a 2D sinwave, possiblity to choose : 
    the angle, 
    the frequency, 
    the number of sample points (image resolution),
    The colormap

The image must stay the same size in the GUI no matter the number of sample points


Future ideas : 
    - Add the possiblity to display 1D sinwaves
    - Add a fourier transform visualization 
    - Possibility to add mutliple frequencies
